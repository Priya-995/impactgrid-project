## 🌍 The Problem We're Solving

When floods hit, when medical emergencies surge, when resources run dry — **help exists, but it doesn't reach people in time**.

Volunteers are ready. Supplies are available. Organizations are willing.

Yet the coordination layer fails. Urgency is misread. The wrong volunteers are dispatched. Critical information drowns in WhatsApp threads.

**The cost? Lives.**

```
❌  Manual coordination   →   Hours of delay
❌  No prioritization     →   Wrong cases attended first
❌  Blind assignments     →   Mismatched volunteers
❌  Zero transparency     →   No accountability
```

---

## ⚡ Enter ImpactGrid

ImpactGrid is a **Decision Intelligence Platform** that sits between crisis and response — acting as the coordination brain that humans can't always be under pressure.

```
CRISIS REPORTED  →  AI ANALYZES  →  BEST MATCH FOUND  →  EXPLAINED  →  ACTION TAKEN
```

We don't just assign volunteers. We **explain why**, ensuring trust, transparency, and smarter decisions at every step.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 📌 Case Reporting System
Structured intake form capturing severity, category, location, and resource needs — fed directly into the prioritization engine.

### 🙋 Volunteer Registration & Profiles
Volunteers register with skills, availability, and preferred case types. This becomes the input layer for intelligent matching.

### 🔍 Explainable Matching Engine *(Core Innovation)*
Unlike black-box systems, ImpactGrid tells you **exactly** why a volunteer was chosen:

```yaml
Volunteer: Priya Sharma
Match Score: 87%

Reasoning:
  ✅ Skill Match:       Medical First Aid + Flood Rescue    → +40pts
  ✅ Proximity:         2.1 km from incident location       → +25pts
  ✅ Availability:      Available immediately               → +25pts
  ✅ Category Fit:      Preferred: Medical Emergencies      → +10pts - 13pts deducted (partial skill gap)

Decision: BEST AVAILABLE MATCH — Dispatching now.
```

> Transparency builds trust. Trust drives faster action.

### 🤖 AI Operations Insight Engine
Powered by **Grok API**, ImpactGrid generates real-time operational intelligence:
- 🔴 Identifies high-priority clusters of cases
- 📋 Suggests NGO actions based on active case load
- 📊 Surfaces patterns in crisis data for predictive awareness

### 🔄 Real-Time Dashboard
A live coordination view for NGO operators — active cases, volunteer statuses, assignments, and AI recommendations in one unified screen.

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

> Even a **10-minute reduction** in emergency response time can increase survival rates by up to **40%** in critical medical scenarios.

ImpactGrid is designed to compress that gap — through automation, intelligence, and transparency.

```
⏱  Faster response         →  More lives saved
📦  Better resource use    →  Less waste, more reach
🤝  Smarter coordination   →  Less burnout for NGOs
🧠  Explainable decisions  →  Greater community trust
```
